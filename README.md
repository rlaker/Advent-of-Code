# Advent-of-Code

My attempts at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I intially heard about this through this [article](https://realpython.com/python-advent-of-code/), so I have adopted their testing framework for some of the tasks.

## Helpful articles
For some of these tasks I had to look for help, here are some the articles I used.

- This [repo](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes) is very helpful in general to explain the problems and show interesting solutions.
- Day 6 Lanternfish: Got a bit lost here as I fell into the trap of making individual fish instead of tracking their numbers. I eventually incorporated a solution based on this [article](https://zonito.medium.com/lantern-fish-day-6-advent-of-code-2021-python-solution-4444387a8380)
- Day 8 Seven Segment Search: I so nearly did this one but I had too many if and for statements to understand my issue. This [article](https://zonito.medium.com/seven-segment-search-day-8-advent-of-code-2021-21e5bc965005) helped simplify my approach.
